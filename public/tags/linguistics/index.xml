    <description><![CDATA[Non-fiction What Kind of Creatures Are We? Noam Chomsky (2015) An engrossing synoptic account of the main currents in Chomsky&rsquo;s thinking across his long career. He starts with his contributions to linguistics, moving into the theory of knowledge and ends with reflections on the limits of human understanding and the role and nature of scientific explanation.There is also a chapter discussing the extent to which his linguistic theories and Cartesian orientation in the philosophy of mind influences his libertarian-socialist politics.]]></description>
